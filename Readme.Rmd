Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The included R script, run_analysis.R, performs the following steps:

1. Download & extract the raw data.
2. Load the relevant datafiles into R (as per the project instructions).
3. Merge the training and test data, add the subject, activity and feature information.
4. Add a column that contains the activity name labels.
5. Select only those data columns/features refering to mean or standard deviation measurements.
5. Rename the columns to me more readable.
6. Create a new tidy dataset (output as a txt file) that contains average values by subject and activity.
